# Jalgo-Editor: A CSP-Compatible Inline Editor for Django

This project provides a **Content Security Policy (CSP)-compatible inline editor** built using pure JavaScript and Django-HTML. It ensures security while allowing inline content editing without violating strict CSP rules.

## Overview

In many modern web applications, inline editors often require the use of **unsafe-inline** scripts, which can create security vulnerabilities. This project presents a **CSP-compliant solution** by leveraging Django and vanilla JavaScript without requiring any inline JavaScript execution.
